                Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as calisthenics, isometrics, and plyometrics.

                When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased muscle, tendon, ligament and bone strength and toughness, improved joint function, reduced potential for injury,[2] increased bone density, increased metabolism, increased fitness[3][4] and improved cardiac function.[5] Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of aerobic exercise through circuit training.

                Strength training typically produces lactate in the muscles, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training.
